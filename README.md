# TidepoolApi
Repo to play with OpenAPI v3 schema and generating stub code for either server or client side.

We have an account with [Stoplight](https://next.stoplight.io/tidepool) where we can publish and host API specifications with a nice web UI.

Recommended tool for offline editing OpenAPI specifications: [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/)
