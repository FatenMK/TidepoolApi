# TidepoolApi

This repository stores Tidepool Platform API documentation in [OpenAPI v3](https://www.openapis.org/) format. These definitions can be used to generate stub code for either server or client side.

We have an account with [Stoplight Next](https://next.stoplight.io/tidepool) where we can publish and host API specifications with a nice web UI. However, that service will reach end-of-life on Dec 31, 2021 so we will need to migrate to another solution.

The recommended tool for offline editing OpenAPI specifications is [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/). Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) also offers lots of plug-ins for validating and rendering OpenAPI 3 specifications.
