# TidepoolApi

This repository contains Tidepool Platform API documentation in [OpenAPI v3](https://www.openapis.org/) format with additional narrative content in [Stoplight-flavored](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/studio/docs/Documentation/03a-stoplight-flavored-markdown.md) [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) format which in turn is a less ambiguous formal definition of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
These API definitions can be used to generate stub code for either server or client side.

We have an account with [Stoplight Next](https://next.stoplight.io/tidepool) where we can publish and host API specifications with a nice web UI.
However, that service will reach end-of-life on Dec 31, 2021. We will either migrate to the new [Stoplight Platform](https://tidepool.stoplight.io) solution, or possibly leverage the open-source [Stoplight Elements](https://stoplight.io/open-source/elements/) renderer to embed the documentation directly into Tidepool's [Developer](https://developer.tidepool.org) portal.

The recommended tool for offline editing OpenAPI v3 specifications is [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/).
Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) also offers lots of plug-ins for validating and rendering OpenAPI v3 specifications.
