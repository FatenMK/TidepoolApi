  Client-defined event name.
  The metrics service imposes no restrictions on the event name.
  The event name must be URL-safe, or encoded as such, as it is sent as part of the URL path.
  Current best practice is to prefix the event name with the client application name, such as `blip`,
  followed by the actual event name, such as `Viewed Care Team List`.
  The resulting full event name might be `blip - Viewed Care Team List`, but encoded in URL-safe manner (i.e. converting spaces to `%20`).
  This allows differentiation between recording similar events by different client applications.
