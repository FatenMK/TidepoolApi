  # TODO: investigate this with Darin
  # This `ingredient.v1.yaml` model includes `ingredientarray.v1.yaml` which itself is an array of... `ingredient.v1.yaml`!
  # This creates an infinite recursion, and likely the reason why Stoplight Studio just about dies when loading `data.v1.yaml`
  # More concerning is that the Data Service does not appear to have any limit to that recursion during parsing and validation.
