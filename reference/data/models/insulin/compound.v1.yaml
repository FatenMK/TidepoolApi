  # TODO: investigate this with Darin!
  # This `compound.v1.yaml` model includes `formulation.v1.yaml`, which in turn includes `compoundarray.v1.yaml`, which contains `ncompound.v1.yaml`
  # This creates an infinite recursion, and likely the reason why Stoplight Studio just about dies when loading `../data.v1.yaml`
  # More concerning is that the Data Service does not appear to have any limit to that recursion during parsing and validation.
