title: Device Tags
description: |-
  An array of string tags indicating the function(s) of the device.

  The `deviceTags` array should be fairly self-explanatory as an array of tags indicating the function(s) of a particular device.
  For example, the Insulet OmniPod insulin delivery system has the tags `bgm` and `insulin-pump` since the PDM is both an insulin pump controller and includes a built-in blood glucose monitor.
