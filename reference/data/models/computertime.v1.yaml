title: Computer Time
description: |-
  An ISO 8601 formatted timestamp without any timezone offset information.

  The `computerTime` field encodes the *local* time at upload with no timezone offset information since we are storing `timezone` separately.
  We store this field in order to be able to audit and/or detect the correspondence between the user's browser time and the timezone they selected at the time of upload.
  If the user selected the timezone that was actually in effect for their browser at the time of upload, then applying the stored `timezone` to the UTC Zulu `time` field will match `computerTime`.
  If, on the other hand, the user selected a *different* timezone from that effective in their browser at the time of upload, applying the `timezone` to `time` will *not* match `computerTime`.

  There are some use cases when it is perfectly justified to select a timezone that does *not* reflect the browser's current timezone.
  For example, some insulin pump users do not change the time on their devices when traveling for short periods of time across many timezones, but when uploading a device a user should always choose the timezone that aligns with the most recent data on the device and thus that will *not* match the local browser timezone.
