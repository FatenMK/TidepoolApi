        description: |-
          An ISO 8601 formatted timestamp without any timezone offset information.

          The `computerTime` field encodes the *local* time at upload with no timezone offset information since we are storing `timezone` separately. We store this field in order to be able to audit and/or detect the correspondence between the user's browser time and the timezone they selected at the time of upload. If the user selected the timezone that was actually in effect for their browser at the time of upload, then applying the stored `timezone` to the UTC Zulu `time` field will match `computerTime`. If, on the other hand, the user selected a *different* timezone from that effective in their browser at the time of upload, applying the `timezone` to `time` will *not* match `computerTime`.

          There are some use cases when it is perfectly justified to select a timezone that does *not* reflect the browser's current timezone. For example, some insulin pump users do not change the time on their devices when traveling for short periods of time across many timezones, but when uploading a device a user should always choose the timezone that aligns with the most recent data on the device and thus that will *not* match the local browser timezone.

          A string indicating what variety of processing was used to create the `time` and related fields such as `timezoneOffset` on data in this upload.

          For data auditing purposes, we store a string encoding the type of algorithm used to generate the `time`, `timezoneOffset`, and other related fields from the local `deviceTime`. At present, there are only three options for this value:
          - `across-the-board-timezone` for devices (all BGMs, for example) that cannot have their `deviceTime` values ["bootstrapped" to a UTC `time` value](http://developer.tidepool.io/chrome-uploader/docs/BootstrappingToUTC.html); in such cases, we apply a single user-selected timezone to every `deviceTime` "across the board" to generate the `time` value.
          - `utc-bootstrapping` for devices (most insulin pumps and CGMs) where we use a combination of the user-selected timezone at time of upload, the most recent timestamp on device, and the history of display time changes on the device to infer the correct `time` value for each record.
          - `none` for data sources that already include a UTC-anchored `time` value. At present, the *only* data source for which this is true is Dexcom G5 data coming through Apple's iOS HealthKit integration.

          A string encoding the version of the uploading client.

          A string identifying the software version of the uploading client. For the Chrome uploader, this will be a [semver](http://semver.org/ 'semver')â€”for example, `1.25.2`. For other uploading clients such as Tidepool iOS applications, the format includes the namespace and semver of the app: `org.tidepool.blipnotes:1.25:2`.
