  Image Suffix.
  The suffix may be any additional path segments between the required portions.
  The extension of the suffix will be used as the requested rendition format.
  The only restriction is that if the last path segment contains an extension (ie. contains a dot) then the extension must match the format of the image content.
  If it does not then a `404` error is returned.
  The suffix may be specified to enable sane browser downloads.
