  The path segment may be one of two values, depending on the HTTP method being used.

  `GET` with Image Suffix.
  The suffix may be any additional path segments between the required portions.
  The extension of the suffix will be used as the requested rendition format.
  The only restriction is that if the last path segment contains an extension (ie. contains a dot) then the extension must match the format of the image content.
  If it does not then a `404` error is returned.
  The suffix may be specified to enable sane browser downloads.

  `PUT` with Image Content Intent.
  The intent for the image content.
  It is preferred to only upload the original image content.
  In some cases, however, it is not possible to do so and a smaller, lower resolution or
    lower quality alternate image content must be uploaded prior to (or instead of) uploading the
    original image content.
